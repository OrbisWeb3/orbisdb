## Using the plugin

The Gitcoin Passport plugin for OrbisDB can be used to benefit from those features effortlessly, simply by assigning the plugin to the context you want and selecting the right settings.

### Settings

When installing the plugin youn will have to submit your `Gitcoin Passport API key` and you `Scorer ID` which can be obtained [here]("https://www.scorer.gitcoin.co/").

Once the plugin is installed you will be able to assign it to the context of your choice or use it globally on your OrbisDB instance. To do this you have to enter `Score required` in order to be able to write streams to the context selected. The plugin will then automatically detect if the user has the score required and approve or reject streams based on this.

### API Route

The Gitcoin Passport plugin also exposes an API route that you can use to test from your front-end if the user connected has the required score or not, it's available at the `verify` endpoint and will return a result like this:

```
{
   "has_access": true,
   "address: "0x...",
   "score": 55
}
```
