The EVM Event Listener Plugin allows users to listen to events generated by smart contracts on any any EVM blockchain and save them in OrbisDB, making them easily queryable and filterable. This plugin enables seamless integration of blockchain events into your data management system.

## Features

- **Listen to Smart Contract Events**: Capture events from smart contracts on any EVM blockchain.
- **Store Events in OrbisDB**: Save the captured events for easy querying and filtering.
- **Configurable Settings**: Set up the plugin with minimal configuration.

## Installation

To install the EVM Event Listener Plugin, follow these steps:

1. Install the plugin on your OrbisDB instance.
2. Configure the plugin settings through the user interface.
2. Assign the plugin to the context you want to use it on.

## Configuration

### Settings

The plugin requires the following settings, which can be configured through the user interface:

- **WebSocket RPC URL**: The WebSocket RPC URL to connect to any EVM blockchain.
- **Smart Contract Address**: The address of the smart contract you want to listen to.
- **Smart Contract ABI**: The ABI (Application Binary Interface) of the smart contract to decode event data.

### Example Settings

Here is an example of how the settings might look:

- **WebSocket RPC URL**: `wss://base-blockchain-node.com/ws`
- **Smart Contract Address**: `0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678`
- **Smart Contract ABI**: `[{"constant":true,"inputs":[],"name":"myEvent","outputs":[{"name":"","type":"uint256"}],"payable":false,"stateMutability":"view","type":"event"}]`

## Usage

The plugin initializes by connecting to any EVM blockchain using the provided WebSocket RPC URL and listens to events emitted by the smart contract at the specified address to capture the event data in order to store it in OrbisDB, making those easily queryable and filterable.
